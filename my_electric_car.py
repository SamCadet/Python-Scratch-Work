''' p. 176 Now we can make a new file called my_electric_car.py, import the
ElectricCar class, and make an electric car:'''

from car import ElectricCar

my_tesla = ElectricCar('tesla', 'model s', 2019)

print(my_tesla.get_descriptive_name())
my_tesla.battery.describe_battery()
my_tesla.battery.get_range()

'''

This car has a 75-kWh battery.
This car can go about 260 miles on a full charge.
