Exercise 7.3. The mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan found an infinite series that can be
used to generate a numerical approximation of 1/p:

Write a function called estimate_pi that uses this formula to compute and return an estimate
of pi. It should use a while loop to compute terms of the summation until the last term is
smaller than 1e-15 (which is Python notation for 10ô€€€15). You can check the result by
comparing it to math.pi.
